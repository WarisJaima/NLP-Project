## AI-Powered IELTS Grammar Correction and Essay Generation

## Overview
# This project aims to develop an AI-driven system to assist IELTS candidates in improving their writing skills by offering automated grammar correction, real-time scoring, and AI-generated essays. The system leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to provide structured, IELTS-specific feedback.

### Problem Statement
# Traditional IELTS writing evaluations rely on human graders, leading to high costs, inconsistencies, and delays. Existing automated tools offer basic grammar checks but lack alignment with IELTS-specific criteria such as coherence, cohesion, and task achievement.

### Solution
# The proposed AI system enhances IELTS preparation through:
# Automated Grammar Correction: A fine-tuned T5 model detects and corrects grammatical errors while maintaining coherence.
# AI-Generated Essays: Controlled text generation ensures high-quality, structured essays tailored to IELTS prompts.
# Automated Scoring with DPO: AI assigns band scores based on official IELTS assessment criteria and refines feedback through Direct Preference Optimization.
# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): The system retrieves high-scoring IELTS essays to offer comparative feedback.
### Key Features & Impact
# Scalability & Efficiency: Reduces grading time from days to seconds.
# Fairness & Consistency: Eliminates human bias with standardized AI assessment.
# Cost Reduction: Minimizes dependence on human graders, making IELTS preparation more accessible.
# Global Reach: Enables real-time, high-quality feedback for test-takers worldwide.
### Technical Approach
# Grammar Correction: Fine-tuned T5 transformer trained on error correction datasets.
# Essay Generation: Uses GPT-based models to produce structured IELTS essays.
# Scoring & Feedback: DPO optimizes AI scoring and feedback for accuracy.
# Retrieval-Augmented Feedback: Finds similar high-quality essays for reference.
# Evaluation Metrics
# Grammar Correction: Precision, Recall, F1-score
